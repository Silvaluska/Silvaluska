# 👋 Hi, I’m @Silvaluska

My name is Lucas Silva and I have a degree in civil engineering from the Universidade Federal do Pará (UFPA), I have been working in the area since 2018 and I am currently one of the partners at Aletto Construtora, a company that aims to transform people's lives with the construction or renovation of the house.
